# Express Server

This folder contains the [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) code required to bootstrap the NextJS/React application.

This code should be perceived separately than the React app in the ./src/app folder and should not import any code from the "./src/app" directory.

If Express-side utils and services are needed, create them under this ./src/server directory.
